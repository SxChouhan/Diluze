TokenSwap
Project Description
TokenSwap is a simple Ethereum-based smart contract that allows users to deposit and withdraw ETH tokens. It serves as a basic example of how to implement token swapping functionality on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity.
Project Vision
Our vision is to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of smart contracts and blockchain technology in a straightforward implementation that can be used as a learning tool for developers new to Solidity and Ethereum development.
Key Features

Secure token deposits and withdrawals
Balance tracking for each user
Owner information retrieval
Event logging for deposits and withdrawals
Implementation of basic security checks

Future Scope

Addition of ERC-20 token support
Implementation of token exchange rates
Integration with decentralized exchanges
Addition of time-locked transactions
Fee structure for transactions

üóíÔ∏è Answer
I've created a simple TokenSwap smart contract with three main functions:

deposit(): Allows users to deposit ETH into the contract [1]
withdraw(): Enables users to withdraw their deposited ETH
getOwnerAddressAndBalance(): Returns the contract owner's address and current balance [6]

The contract uses mappings to track user balances and emits events for deposits and withdrawals. The README provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including its description, vision, features, and future scope, following best practices for GitHub documentation. [2][4]
